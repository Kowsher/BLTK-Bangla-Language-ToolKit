# BLTK (Bangla Language Toolkit)
## Developed by [Md. Kowsher](https://sites.google.com/view/kowsher)

he Bangla Language Toolkit, or more commonly BLTK, is a suite of Artificial Intelligence libraries and programs for symbolic analysing for Bangla language written in the Python programming language. We have used machine learning, deep leering, mathematics, and statistical techniques in order to develop BLTK. The main purpose of this tool is to perform computational research on Bangla language so that the Bangla language can keep its value in the world of AI. This tool can be significant for the business, economics, E-commerce, office, bank, and other sectors. Till we have developed various computational linguistics techniques on Bangle Language such as Chatbot, Lemmatization, Spelling Checker, Semantic Analysing, Topics Modeling, etc.  Till we have completed the system behind the BLTK are summarized as:  

1. Text Classification and Categorisation 

2. Named Entity Recognition 

3. Chatbot or intelligence bot 

4. Part-of-Speech Tagging

 5. Semantic Parsing and Question Answering 

6. Paraphrase Detection 

7. Language Generation and Multi-document Summarization 

8. Spell Checking 

9. Mathematical and statistical operation : SVD, NMF, LDA, PCA on bangla language 

## Still private mode, very soon it will be open for all. If you interest to use it, feel free to email me
